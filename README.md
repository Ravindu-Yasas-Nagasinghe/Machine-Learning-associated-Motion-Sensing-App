# Machine-Learning-associated-Motion-Sensing-App
This repository contains the development of a Machine Learning associated motion sensing app. he basic software tool used to develop the app is Android Studio.

This app that could classify the motion of a mobile device into 7 different motion
classes as, 
1. walking forward
2. walking backward
3. tuning left
4. turning right
5. driving forward
6. driving backward
7. standing still

The mobile device's motion was classified using an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a support vector machine. 
I first developed the app without SVM and then included SVM for better classification and smoothness of output.
Trained the model using 100 data points.
